## Introduction

**Progrify** is an AI-powered online code editor designed to revolutionize how people learn and write code. With seamless integration of CopilotKit, Progrify acts as your personal programming tutor, guiding you through coding challenges, helping you debug, and optimizing your learning experience. Whether you're a beginner trying to grasp programming concepts or a seasoned developer looking to write more efficient code, Progrify makes coding interactive, intuitive, and effective.

## Problem Statement

Many learners struggle with understanding programming concepts when learning on their own. Traditional code editors lack intelligent feedback mechanisms, making it harder for beginners to catch mistakes, understand syntax errors, and optimize code. As a result, learners can become frustrated and lose motivation.

## Objectives

The goal of Progrify is to build a code editor that provides real-time AI assistance and helps users:

1. **Interactive Learning**: Facilitate programming learning through an AI assistant, enabling users to ask questions and receive guidance as they code.
   
2. **Mistake Identification**: Detect errors in code quickly, offering detailed explanations and suggestions for corrections.

3. **Effective Tutoring**: Allow Copilot to serve as a tutor that explains concepts, optimizes code, and provides tips on best practices.

4. **Ease of Use**: Offer a highly interactive and user-friendly interface that promotes seamless coding experiences.

5. **Enhanced Productivity**: Improve coding productivity by enabling users to focus on logic rather than syntax and boilerplate errors.

## Key Features

Progrify includes the following features to help users learn and write code efficiently:

1. **AI-Powered Code Suggestions**: Integrated with CopilotKit to provide AI-assisted coding suggestions, explanations, and debugging support.

2. **Real-Time Error Detection**: Automatically catch mistakes and errors in real-time with detailed feedback, allowing users to learn from their errors.

3. **Interactive Tutoring**: Users can ask the AI questions about programming concepts, algorithms, and coding techniques directly within the editor.

4. **Execution of Code**: Run code directly within the editor to see outputs and test for errors, streamlining the learning process.

5. **Beautiful UI**: Progrify boasts an intuitive and clean user interface that makes coding enjoyable, with interactive elements to engage users as they learn.

## Expected Outcomes

By using Progrify, learners and developers can expect:

1. **Accelerated Learning**: Learn programming faster with instant feedback from the AI, improving your problem-solving and coding skills.

2. **Increased Efficiency**: Spend less time troubleshooting and more time writing functional, optimized code with real-time AI suggestions and corrections.

3. **Confidence in Coding**: Gain confidence in your coding abilities by having an AI tutor that provides clear explanations and guidance on best practices.

4. **Seamless Code Execution**: Easily write, test, and refine code in one place, without switching between multiple tools.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Enjoy a smooth and interactive coding experience with an interface designed for both beginners and experienced developers.
